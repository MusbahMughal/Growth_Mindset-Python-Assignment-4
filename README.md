**Growth_Mindset – Python Assignment 4**

This project is part of my Python coursework and focuses on applying core programming concepts through the theme of Growth Mindset. 
The assignment includes multiple Python exercises and small programs that reflect key ideas like continuous learning, self-improvement,
and overcoming challenges—values that are essential in both personal development and programming.
